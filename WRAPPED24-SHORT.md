**January – The Month of New Beginnings**  
I ditched job hunting, dove into building projects, founded GPTHub, and earned LinkedIn badges. Kicked off streaming, freelancing, and published my first Flutter package.  

**February – The Month of AI Adventures**  
I built Spotius, AstroAI, and JobViz, won a hackathon with AstroAI, and joined Microsoft for Startups. Explored Midjourney/DALL-E, interned at Nobel Learning, and started CoMed (AI for Brain MRIs).  

**March – The Month of Sharing and Learning**  
I wrapped up Upwork gigs, posted more articles, tackled the GDSC Solution Challenge, and marveled at Neuralink’s brain-chip demo. Rejected by Wolfram Summer School, but kept mentoring.  

**April – The Month of Rejections**  
I pitched CoMedAI to Y Combinator solo and got a chorus of rejections (Snap, Next Shift, Cornell, Yale, Brown, Stanford, USC, Tufts, and Stanford Code In Place). Finished a 3-month EPAM course in a week.  

**May – The Month of Stories and Discovery**  
I got rejected by EPAM but published loads of tutorials on YouTube. Wrote my first short story, explored 30 AI papers, and dabbled in Rust. Ditching Work & Travel, I focused on building.  

**June – The Month of Mixed Triumphs**  
I faced my first YC rejection, then got into Buildspace and Night & Weekends. Started a GenAI internship at HeadOn, created Open Community, and won a ticket to SF. Also snagged a camera prize at a youth camp.  

**July – The Month of Growth**  
I wrapped CoMedAI’s new version, built MeWell AI (3rd place), and joined Headstarter’s Fellowship. Got selected for HPAIR but missed it due to funding. Added voice to Langflow, cutting build times.  

**August – The Month of Persistence**  
I couldn’t attend Buildspace IRL (no US visa), but I built five AI projects in five weeks. Created MonkeytypeAI (won a PS5!), rebuilt CoMedAI, and started senior year while reading “Zero to One.”  

**September – The Month of Firsts**  
I submitted a video for the IES program, ended my HeadOn internship (30+ papers reviewed), and gave my first conference talk in Almaty. Became a CAREC USG2024 finalist, mentored for The Earth Prize, and saw my tweet hit 90K views.  

**October – The Month of Big Wins**  
I published my first Scopus-indexed paper with Springer Nature and won NASA Space Apps with StoryAI. Got my first IES Skype interview, built PaperAI (Top 100), and snagged a Knight-Hennessy application.  

**November – The Month of Big Shifts**  
I pivoted from AlphaFold to STM-32/ASCON cryptography. Reapplied to YC with PaperAI 2.0, launched Open Community (plus an AI startup album), and dropped a viral video. Kept hitting Topmate records, built AI Coding Interviewer, and got featured by big newsletters.  

**December – The Month of Going Viral**  
I failed YC again but finished “The Pathless Path.” Open Community went viral, fake meme coins appeared, and one spiked from \$5K to \$4M in 1h. Ranked in Top 1% on Topmate and heading to Times Square next.  

**Final Notes**  
- Over 70 hackathons, 400+ failed applications, and 5 papers (1 published, 4 under review).
- Open Community: 170+ developers, 15+ projects, world's 1st AI startup album, and my close friend's mum listen on repeat.
- Mentored 200K+ people, did all project building, pitching, designing, and research by myself (just to learn the stuff).
